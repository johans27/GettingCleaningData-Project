Getting and Cleaning Data Project
===========================

The aim of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set [1]. The goal is to obtain tidy data that can be used for future analysis.

## The Script
The script works to get a tidy data. This script is a combination of distinct topics which were learnt during the course such as editing text variables, regular expressions, summarizing and the like. In order to obtain our tidy data is important to know that your file which was download must be saved in your default working directory (When you type getwd).

## Summarized project steps
1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.	Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
